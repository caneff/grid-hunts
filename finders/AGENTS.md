# finders/AGENTS.md

Grid finders: JavaScript-adjacent Python code that hunts, verifies, and
renders candidate grids for constraint prototypes. The `.py` finder code
lives here; notes, hunt outputs, precomputed catalogues, and the `.sh`
drivers that launch a hunt overnight stay under `docs/research/` (#469).

## Renbanana chocolate facts are precalculated (always on)

- **Never re-derive a chocolate rectangle fact the catalogue already holds.**
  `docs/research/renbanana/rectangle-catalogue.json` enumerates, per shape and
  per box offset, which placements can be filled at all, the per-cell digit
  domains, and which cells can carry a circle. Every generator question about
  a chocolate rectangle is answered from it, in stage 1 and stage 3 alike —
  not left for the solver to search out on each shading.
- It is layer B (the rectangle plus the boxes, nothing outside), so a real grid
  only narrows its answers. That is what makes reading it sound.
- `finders/renbanana/tools/test_catalogue_is_used.py` fails if a call site
  drops it. Run it after touching `renbanana_cpsat.py`.
